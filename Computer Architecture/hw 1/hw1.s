// question 3
@ a) How many locations of memory (in terms of the number of bytes) can you address with 17-bit memory address?   
    @ - 2^17 = 131072 locations
@ b)
@ How many bits are required to address a 64-Mega-location memory, i.e, what should the number of bits of the memory address be in order to access a 64MB memory? 
    @ - 64MB = 64*1024*1024 = 67108864 bytes
@ c)

@ d)

@ e)

// question 9
@ Write a sequence of LEGv8 instructions to do the following:
@ set X8 to 100 if the contents of X1 is an odd number and set X9 to 200 otherwise. 
@ Do not use division instruction in you code. Instead, you use an AND instruction to test if a number is even or odd.   

// mask all but the least significant bit of X1
AND X10, X1, #1 // X10 = X1 & 1 = 0
// test if X10 is 0, if so, jump to EVEN, else jump to next instruction
CBZ X10, EVEN 
// if not 0, must be odd
