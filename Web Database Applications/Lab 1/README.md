```
Write a php script that assigns your name to a string variable, the number of credits you are taking to an integer variable, and any value to a floating point variable.
The html rendered page should show the types of the variables and the values of the variables . Use the vardump function to print out the types of the variables.
Your html page should also display a welcome message to the name that is stored in a string variable. If the credits are >= 12, the displayed html page will have the message "FULL TIME STUDENT", otherwise the diplayed html page will have the message "PART TIME STUDENT"
```

```
1. Put your entire file inside php tags, and use echo for all output.
   AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE, PRINT OUT THE FILE NAME THAT IS RUNNING, THE SERVER SOFTWARE, THE HOST IP ADDRESS, AND THE NAME OF THE BROWSER THAT IS BEING USED. HOW DO YOU DO THIS? PHP HAS PREDEFINED VARIABLES THAT YOU CAN USE. SEE https://tryphp.w3schools.com/showphp.php?filename=demo_global_server
